# inkyphat_weather
code to display current and near-term weather conditions on a an inky pHAT eInk screen 
Using the [Dark Sky API](https://darksky.net/dev/) and @lukaskubis Python wrapper 
[darkskylib](https://github.com/lukaskubis/darkskylib/). 

## Acknowledgements
I took inspiration from @AlanCunningham [Inky pHAT Dark Sky weather display](https://github.com/AlanCunningham/inkyphat-darksky-weather-display/) 
The icons are based on Adam Whitcroftâ€™s [Climacons](http://adamwhitcroft.com/climacons/) but I used Gimp to convert the images to the custom pallet that the inky pHAT requires.
If you are new to the Inky pHAT, you should read the Pimoroni pages about it [Getting Started with Inky pHAT](https://learn.pimoroni.com/tutorial/sandyj/getting-started-with-inky-phat)

## dependencies and requirements
- You will need to get an API key from Dark Sky and know your longitude and latitude
- [Inky pHAT library](https://github.com/pimoroni/inky)
- [darkyskylib](https://github.com/lukaskubis/darkskylib)
